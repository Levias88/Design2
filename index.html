  <p>There Is Nothing New Under The Sun.</p>

     This sentiment echoes throughout history which, in a way, verifies the claim itself. Design is much the same. Think of it as a snake eating its own tail. It feels like it is making progress and yet it is just going in circles. The wise man once said, “That which has been is what will be, that which is done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun. Is there anything of which it may be said, “See, this is new”? It has already been in ancient times before us. There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come by those who will come after.” As designers, we have a constant craving to create something truly new. This is an impossible task. Design is inspiration. The two concepts are intertwined. As humans, we are constantly taking in the environment around us and, in turn, recreating what we are consuming. We do this subconsciously most of the time, but the process is in constant motion.

  One example of this is the very snake mentioned earlier. You may know it as the ouroboros, but it hasn’t always been known as such. The first sighting of this symbol was found in an ancient funerary text called the Enigmatic Book of the Netherworld which was found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The symbol is thought to represent the unified Ra-Osiris. This symbol was again found in China on a piece of pottery in the yellow river basin. It belonged to the Yangshao culture. This symbol makes a third appearance around 3rd century Alexandria in the The Chrysopoeia of Cleopatra, an early alchemical text and may represent the gnostic duality of existence. These are only a few of the different ways this symbol has been utilized by different cultures in different time periods. Even though the meaning of this symbol has changed, the symbol has remained a constant.

  What then? Do we stop pursuing the unique? Certainly not! By striving to create something truly new, we are following in the steps of the designers that came before us. In doing so, we create a pattern over history much like the pattern made by the scales on the snake’s body. Not every scale is the exact same, but they all come together to make something beautiful.
